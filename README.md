## Optimizations

Next.js Framework: Leveraged Next.js, a lightweight and fast frontend framework, for its built-in optimizations like server-side rendering and static generation.

Custom Reusable React Hooks: Designed custom hooks to encapsulate common logic, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

Performance-Oriented Hooks:

Utilized useCallback to memoize functions and prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Used useMemo to memoize computed values, ensuring expensive calculations are performed only when necessary.

Reusable Components for Animations: Built modular and reusable components to handle animations efficiently, ensuring smooth gameplay without compromising performance.

Lazy Loading: Implemented lazy loading for components, ensuring only the required parts of the app are loaded when needed, reducing initial load time.

Image Optimization: Used Next.js's next/image for image optimization, lazy loading, and responsive resizing.

Use CSS transitions instead of JavaScript-based animations where possible for GPU-accelerated rendering.
